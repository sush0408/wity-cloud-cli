# Script Improvements Based on Debugging

## Overview
Based on the comprehensive debugging performed with the test scripts, several critical improvements have been incorporated into the main deployment scripts (`monitoring.sh` and `management.sh`) to make them more resilient and production-ready.

## Key Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Dual Domain Support**
**Problem**: Ingresses only supported nip.io domains, not dev.tese.io
**Solution**: All ingress functions now create both domains automatically:
- `service.65.109.113.80.nip.io` (immediate access)
- `service.dev.tese.io` (requires Route53 setup)

### 2. **TLS/HTTPS Redirect Issues**
**Problem**: TLS configurations caused automatic HTTPS redirects, leading to certificate failures
**Solution**: 
- Remove TLS configurations from HTTP-only ingresses
- Clean up failed certificates automatically
- Prevent HTTPS redirect middleware from being applied

### 3. **Certificate Management**
**Problem**: Failed certificates and ACME challenges accumulated, causing issues
**Solution**: Added `cleanup_failed_certificates()` function that:
- Removes failed certificates across all namespaces
- Cleans up failed certificate requests
- Removes ACME solver ingresses

### 4. **PgAdmin Permission Issues**
**Problem**: PgAdmin had permission denied errors for sessions directory
**Solution**: Enhanced deployment with:
- Proper security context (runAsUser: 5050, fsGroup: 5050)
- Resource limits and requests
- Health checks (readiness and liveness probes)
- Non-root container execution

### 5. **Loki Namespace Issues**
**Problem**: Loki ingress was created in wrong namespace (default instead of loki)
**Solution**: 
- Automatic ingress creation in correct namespace
- Proper service discovery and routing

## Improvements by Script

### monitoring.sh Enhancements

#### New Functions Added:
- `setup_loki_ingress()` - Creates Loki ingress in correct namespace
- `cleanup_failed_certificates()` - Removes failed certificates system-wide

#### Enhanced Functions:
- `setup_grafana_ingress()` - Now supports dual domains and TLS cleanup
- `setup_prometheus_ingress()` - Dual domain support and resilient updates
- `install_loki()` - Automatically sets up ingress after installation

#### Menu Updates:
- Added "Setup Loki Ingress" option
- Added "Cleanup Failed Certificates" option

### management.sh Enhancements

#### New Functions Added:
- `setup_pgadmin_ingress()` - Creates clean ingress with dual domain support
- `setup_rancher_ingress()` - HTTP ingress for Rancher with dual domains

#### Enhanced Functions:
- `install_pgadmin()` - Fixed permission issues, added health checks, dual domain support
- `install_rancher()` - Automatically sets up HTTP ingress after installation

#### Menu Updates:
- Added "Setup pgAdmin Ingress" option
- Added "Setup Rancher Ingress" option

## Resilience Features Added

### 1. **Automatic Issue Detection and Fixing**
- Ingress functions now detect existing problematic configurations
- Automatic cleanup of TLS configurations that cause issues
- Smart patching of existing ingresses instead of recreation

### 2. **Dual Domain Strategy**
- Every service gets both nip.io and dev.tese.io domains
- nip.io provides immediate access without DNS setup
- dev.tese.io provides production-ready domains with Route53

### 3. **Certificate Management**
- Proactive cleanup of failed certificates
- Prevention of TLS configuration on HTTP-only services
- Removal of ACME solver ingresses that can cause conflicts

### 4. **Health Monitoring**
- Added readiness and liveness probes to PgAdmin
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Proper security contexts for container security

### 5. **Error Recovery**
- Functions can be run multiple times safely (idempotent)
- Automatic detection and fixing of common misconfigurations
- Graceful handling of existing deployments

## Testing Integration

The debugging scripts in the `test/` folder can be used for:
- **Pre-deployment validation**: Run `test/dns_test.sh` to verify DNS setup
- **Post-deployment verification**: Run `test/status_summary.sh` for complete status
- **Issue diagnosis**: Run `test/ingress_debug.sh` for detailed troubleshooting
- **Manual fixes**: Use `test/fix_dev_tese_access.sh` for emergency repairs

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and cleanup
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: HTTP-only configurations to avoid certificate issues
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with working HTTP, add HTTPS later if needed
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Clear status messages and error reporting
5. **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to run multiple times
6. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate functions for different aspects (ingress, certificates, etc.)

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Fresh Deployments**: The enhanced scripts will create optimal configurations from the start
2. **Existing Deployments**: Run the individual ingress setup functions to upgrade existing services
3. **Troubleshooting**: Use the test scripts to diagnose issues before manual intervention
4. **Maintenance**: Periodically run `cleanup_failed_certificates()` to maintain system health

These improvements ensure that the deployment scripts are production-ready and can handle real-world scenarios with minimal manual intervention.
