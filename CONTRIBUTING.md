4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Ensure your code follows our style guidelines**
6. **Submit a pull request**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu/Debian-based system (recommended for testing)
- Root/sudo access
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Bash scripting and Kubernetes

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wity-cloud-cli.git
cd wity-cloud-cli

# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make the scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Test the basic functionality
sudo ./check-dependencies.sh
```

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a pull request, please test your changes:

```bash
# Run system checks
sudo ./troubleshoot.sh

# Test specific components
sudo ./core.sh  # Test core functionality
sudo ./databases.sh  # Test database deployments
sudo ./monitoring.sh  # Test monitoring stack

# Run integration tests (if available)
sudo ./tests/run-tests.sh
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Bash Script Guidelines

1. **Use consistent indentation** (2 spaces)
2. **Add proper error handling** with meaningful error messages
3. **Use descriptive variable names** in UPPER_CASE for globals
4. **Add comments** for complex logic
5. **Follow the existing function structure**
6. **Use the common.sh functions** for consistency

### Example Function Structure

```bash
function your_function_name() {
  section "Your Function Description"
  
  # Check prerequisites
  if ! check_kubectl; then
    echo -e "${RED}Cannot access Kubernetes cluster${NC}"
    return 1
  fi
  
  # Ask for approval in interactive mode
  if ! ask_approval "Do you want to proceed with this action?"; then
    return 0
  fi
  
  # Your implementation here
  echo -e "${YELLOW}Performing action...${NC}"
  
  # Error handling
  if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo -e "${RED}Action failed${NC}"
    return 1
  fi
  
  echo -e "${GREEN}‚úÖ Action completed successfully${NC}"
}
```

### Documentation Standards

1. **Update README.md** if your changes affect user-facing functionality
2. **Add inline comments** for complex logic
3. **Update the component matrix** if adding new components
4. **Create or update documentation** in the `docs/` folder for major features

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **Test on a clean system** when possible
2. **Test both interactive and batch modes**
3. **Verify error handling** by introducing failures
4. **Test rollback scenarios** where applicable
5. **Document any new testing procedures**

### Automated Testing

We encourage adding automated tests for new functionality:

```bash
# Create test files in the tests/ directory
tests/test-your-feature.sh

# Follow the existing test structure
#!/bin/bash
source ./common.sh

function test_your_feature() {
  section "Testing Your Feature"
  
  # Test implementation
  # Assert expected outcomes
  
  echo -e "${GREEN}‚úÖ Test passed${NC}"
}

# Run if script is called directly
if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
  test_your_feature
fi
```

## üìã Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your PR has a clear title and description**
2. **Reference any related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"
3. **Include screenshots or logs** if relevant
4. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** if your changes are user-facing
5. **Ensure all tests pass**
6. **Request review** from maintainers
